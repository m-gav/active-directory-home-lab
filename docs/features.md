# Features

This Active Directory homelab was built using Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 clients in Oracle VirtualBox.  
It demonstrates my ability to configure, manage, and troubleshoot Active Directory in a real-world environment.

## Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Configured Windows Server 2025 as a Domain Controller

## Group Policy Management

## DNS & Networking

## Administration Practice
- Simulated helpdesk tasks: unlocking accounts, resetting passwords, moving users

## Extensible Design
This homelab can be expanded with:  
- File and Print Services

# Features

This Active Directory homelab was built using Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 clients in Oracle VirtualBox.  
It demonstrates my ability to configure, manage, and troubleshoot Active Directory in a real-world environment.

## ðŸ–¥Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Configured Windows Server 2025 as a Domain Controller  
- Installed AD DS and DNS roles  
- Built a domain forest (`homelab.local`)  
- Added multiple domain-joined Windows 11 clients

##  User and Group Management
- Created users and departmental groups  
- Implemented Organizational Units (OUs) for IT, HR, Management, and Finance  
- Practiced password resets, account lockouts, and group assignments

## Group Policy Management
- Configured password policy (length, complexity, expiration)  
- Deployed a desktop wallpaper GPO (visual proof of GPO enforcement)  
- Applied login banner for security compliance  
- Disabled Control Panel access for standard users

## DNS & Networking
- Configured DNS zones on the Domain Controller  
- Verified name resolution and connectivity between clients and DC  
- Built a VirtualBox Internal Network for isolation

## Administration Practice
- Simulated helpdesk tasks: unlocking accounts, resetting passwords, moving users  
- Used a Helpdesk admin account with limited permissions to mimic real-world workflows

## Extensible Design
This homelab can be expanded with:  
- File and Print Services  
- DHCP Server  
- Security monitoring (e.g., SIEM, Splunk, Sysmon)  
- Additional Domain Controllers for redundancy

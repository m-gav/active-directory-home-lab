 # Active Directory Home Lab
 This project is a Windows Server 2025 Active Directory home lab I built in Oracle VirtualBox to practice and demonstrate IT administration skills. It simulates a small enterprise network environment, including a domain controller and Windows 11 client machines joined to the domain.
